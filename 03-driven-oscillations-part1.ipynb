Alternatively, from a realistic point of view, steady-state solutions represent the response after the system has settled down into a permanent pattern. If any friction is present, any transient (or non-steady-state) behavior has decayed away. In that sense, initial conditions of the system have been erased, and so they do not appear in the solution.
